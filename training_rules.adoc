= MLPerf Training Rules
Version 0.5 
May 2nd, 2018

== Overview
This document describes how to implement the MLPerf Training Suite using an ML framework and how to use that implementation to measure the performance of an ML software framework or hardware. 

The MLPerf name and logo are trademarks. In order to refer to a result using the MLPerf name, the result must conform to the letter and spirit of the rules specified in this document. The MLPerf organization reserves the right to solely determine if a use of its name or logo is acceptable.

=== Definitions (read this section carefully)
The following definitions are used throughout this document:

_Performance_ always refers to execution speed.

_Quality_ always refers to a model’s ability to produce “correct” outputs.

A _system_ consists of a defined set of hardware resources such as processors, memories, disks, and interconnect. It also includes specific versions of all software such as operating system, compilers, libraries, and drivers that significantly influences the running time of a benchmark, excluding the ML framework.

A _framework_ is a specific version of a software library or set of related libraries, possibly with associated offline compiler, for training ML models using a system. Examples include specific versions of Caffe2, MXNet, PaddlePaddle, pyTorch, or TensorFlow.

A _benchmark_ is an abstract problem that can be solved using ML by training a model based on a specific dataset or simulation environment to a target quality level. 

A _suite_ is a specific set of benchmarks.

A _division_ is a set of rules for implementing benchmarks friom a suite to produce a class of comparable results.

A _reference implementation_ is a specific implementation of a benchmark provided by the MLPerf organization. 

A _benchmark implementation_ is an implementation of a benchmark in a particular framework by a user under the rules of a specific division.

A _submission implementation set_ is a set of benchmark implementations for one or more benchmarks from a suite under the rules of a specific division using the same framework.

A _run_ is a complete execution of an implementation on a system, training a model from initialization to the quality target.

A _run result_ is the wallclock time required for a run.

A _reference result_ is the result provided by the MLPerf organization for each reference implementation

A _benchmark result_ is the mean of a benchmark-specific number of run results, dropping the highest and lowest results. The result is then normalized to the reference result for that benchmark. Normalization is of the form (reference result / benchmark result) such that a better benchmark result produces a higher number.

A _submission result set_ is a one benchmark result for each benchmark implementation in a  submission implementation set.

A _submission_ is a submission implementation set and a corresponding submission result set.

A _custom summary result_ is the weighted geometric mean of an arbitrary set of results from a specific submission. MLPerf v0.5 endorses this methodology for computing custom summary results but does not endorse any official summary result. 

== General rules
The following rules apply to all benchmark implementations.

=== Strive to be fair
Benchmarking should be conducted to measure the framework and system performance as fairly as possible. Ethics and reputation matter.

=== System and framework must be consistent
The same system and framework must be used for a submission result set. Note that the reference implementations do not all use the same framework in v0.5.

=== System and framework must be available
If you are measuring the performance of a publicly available and widely-used system or framework, you must use publicly available and widely-used used versions of the system or framework.

If you are measuring the performance of an experimental framework or system, you must make the system and framework you use available upon demand for replication. 

=== Benchmark implementations must be shared
Source code used for the benchmark implementations must be open-sourced under a license that permits a commercial entity to freely use the implementation for benchmarking. The code must be available as long as the results are actively used.

=== Benchmark detection is not allowed
The framework and system should not detect and behave differently for benchmarks.

=== Pre-training is not allowed
The implementation should not encode any information about the content of the dataset or a successful model’s state in any form.

== Benchmarks
The benchmark suite consists of the benchmarks shown in the following table.

|===
|Area|Problem |Dataset |Quality Target

|Vision |Image classification |ImageNet |75.90% classification (v0.5 was 74.9%)
| |Object detection (light weight) |COCO |21.2% mAP
| |Object detection (heavy weight) |COCO |0.377 Box min AP and 0.339 Mask min AP
|Language |Translation (recurrent) |WMT English-German |21.8 Sacre BLEU
| |Translation (non-recurrent) |WMT English-German |25.00 BLEU
|Commerce |Recommendation |MovieLens-20M |0.635 HR@10
|General |Reinforcement learning |Go |40.00% pro move prediction

== Divisions
There are two divisions of the benchmark suite, the Closed division and the Open division. 

=== Closed Division
The Closed division requires using the same preprocessing, model, and training method as the reference implementation.

The closed division models are:

|===
|Area |Problem |Model

|Vision |Image classification |Resnet-50 v1.5
| |Object detection (light weight)|SSD
| |Object detection (heavy weight) |Mask R-CNN
|Language |Speech recognition |Deep Speech 2
| |Translation (recurrent) |NMT
| |Translation (non-recurrent) |Transformer
|Commerce |Recommendation |Neural Collaborative Filtering
|General |Reinforcement learning |Mini Go (based on Alpha Go paper)
|===

Closed division benchmarks must be referred to using the benchmark name plus the term Closed, e.g. “for the Image Classification Closed benchmark, the system achieved a result of 7.2.”

=== Open Division
The Open division allows using arbitrary preprocessing, model, and/or training method. However, the Open division still requires using supervised or reinforcement machine learning in which a model is iteratively improved based on training data, simulation, or self-play.

Open division benchmarks must be referred to using the benchmark name plus the term Open, e.g. “for the Image Classification Open benchmark, the system achieved a result of 7.2.”

== Basics 

=== Random numbers
CLOSED: Random numbers must be generated using stock random number generators. 

Random number generators may be seeded from the following sources:

* Clock
* System source of randomness, e.g. /dev/random or /dev/urandom
* Another random number generator initialized with an allowed seed

Random number generators may be initialized repeatedly in muliple processes or threads. For a single run, the same seed may be shared across multiple processes or threads.

OPEN: Any random number generation may be used.

=== Numerical formats
CLOSED: The numerical formats fp64, fp32, fp16, and bfloat16 are pre-approved for use. Additional formats require explicit approval. Scaling may be added where required to compensate for different precision.

OPEN: Any format and scaling may be used.

=== Epoch numbering
Epochs should always be numbered from 0.

=== Result rounding
Public results should be rounded normally.

== Data Set

=== Data State at Start of Run
Each reference implementation includes a script to download the input dataset and script to verify the dataset using a checksum. 

The data must then be preprocessed in a manner consistent with the reference implementation, excepting any transformations that must be done for each run (e.g. random transformations). The data may also be reformatted for the target system provided that the reformatting does not introduce new information or introduce duplicate copies of data. This policy is intended to simplify v0.5 and will be reconsidered.  

You must flush the cache or restart the system prior to benchmarking.	Data can start on any durable storage system such as local disks and cloud storage systems. This explicitly excludes RAM.	

=== Preprocessing During the Run
Only preprocessing that must be done for each run (e.g. random transformations) must be timed.

CLOSED: The same preprocessing steps as the reference implementation must be used. 

OPEN: Any preprocessing steps are allowed. However, each datum must be preprocessed individually in a manner that is not influenced by any other data.

=== Data Representation

CLOSED: Images must have the same size as in the reference implementation. Mathematically equivalent padding of images is allowed.

CLOSED: For benchmarks with sequence inputs, you may choose a length N and either truncate all examples to length N or throw out all examples which exceed length N. This must be done uniformly for all examples. This may only be done on the training set and not the evaluation set. 

CLOSED: Two ways to represent the Mask R-CNN mask are permitted. One is a polygon and the other is a scalable bitmask. 

OPEN: The closed division data representations restrictions only apply at the start of the run. Data may be represented in an arbitrary fashion during the run.


=== Training and Test Sets
If applicable, the dataset must be separated into training and test sets in the same manner as the reference implementation.

=== Training Data Order
CLOSED: the training and test data must be traversed in the same conceptual order as the reference implementation. For instance, the data might be traversed sequentially or randomly with uniform distribution. Batch size, shard size, and the random number generator will affect order.

Future versions of the benchmark suite may specify the Closed traversal order.

OPEN: the training data may be traversed in any order. The test data must be traversed in the same order as the reference implementation.

== RL Environment
CLOSED: The implementation must use the same RL algorithm and simulator or game as the reference implementation, with the same parameters. 

OPEN: The implementation may use a different RL algorithm but must use the same simulator or game with the same parameters. If the reference implementation generates all data online, the Open division implementation must also generate all data online.

It is allowed and encouraged to parallelize and otherwise optimize (e.g. by implementing in a compiled language) the RL environment provided that the semantics are preserved.

== Model
CLOSED: The benchmark implementation must use the same model as the reference implementation, as defined by the remainder of this section.

OPEN: The benchmark implementation may use a different model. 

=== Graph Definition

CLOSED: Each of the current frameworks has a graph that describes the operations performed during the forward propagation of training. The frameworks automatically infer and execute the corresponding back-propagation computations from this graph. Benchmark implementations must use the same graph as the reference implementation.

=== Weight and Bias Initialization
CLOSED: Weights and biases must be initialized using the same constant or random value distribution as the reference implementation.

OPEN: Weights and biases must be initialized using a consistent constant or random value distribution. 

=== Graph Execution
CLOSED: Frameworks are free to optimize the non-weight parts of the computation graph provided that the changes are mathematically equivalent. So optimizations and graph / code transformations of the flavor of dead code elimination, common subexpression elimination, loop-invariant code motion, and recomputation of node state are entirely allowed. 

OPEN: Frameworks are free to alter the graph.

== Training Loop

=== Hyperparameters and Optimizer
CLOSED: 

For v0.5, the following rules apply:

By default, the hyperparameters and optimizer must be the same as the reference. Hyperparameters include regularization terms such as norms and weight decays.

The following scheme for scaling learning rate schedule and adding warmup applies to all models that use SGD.

* An arbitrary batch size may be chosen to allow for tailoring the application to the hardware platform’s memory hierarchy. The batch size must be constant for the entire run, with the exception of the final batch in each epoch which may be smaller to account for the remainder when the number of samples is divided by batch.

* Learning rate may be changed to accommodate the change in batch size or different precision. The learning rate schedule is defined relative to the reference implementation using four parameters wb, wr, t, and r:
** A linear warm-up period of wb batches may be added with a per batch step size wr. It is assumed that the reference implementation learning rate is a constant r0 for more than wb batches. Then the warm up learning rate for batch b is r0 - (wb - b) * wr. The term wr is contrained to be (r0 / (wb * 2^wk)) where wk is a non-negative integer.
** The learning rate schedule may be scaled in time by multiplying the input epoch by a constant factor t and rounding down, where t is constrained to be (1 + tk/10) where tk is a positive integer.
** The learning rate may be scaled by a constant factor r, where r is an integer.

The following model-specific exceptions are also allowed:

|===
|Model |Hyperparameter |Change allowed


|ResNet |base learning rate |0.1 or 0.128
|SSD |lr2 weight decay |Arbitrary constant
| |maximum number of samples attempted when generating a training patch for a given IoU choice
|Arbitrary integer >= 1
|Mask R-CNN |number of image candidates | 2000 or 1000*batch_size patches (may sample either from a pool of all examples, or individually and uniformly from each image)
|NCF |optimizer |Adam or Lazy Adam
| |lr |Arbitrary constant
| |beta1 |Arbitrary constant
| |beta2 |Arbitrary constant
|GNMT |learning rate |Arbitrary constant
| |learning rate decay function |May use alt_decay fn in reference
| |decay_start (number of updates after which the first lr decay occurs) |Arbitrary constant
| |decay_interval (number of updates between lr decays) |Arbitrary constant
| |warmup function |May use alt_warmup fn in reference
| |learning_rate_warmup_steps |Arbitary constant, suggest 200
|Transformer |optimizer |Adam or Lazy Adam
| |lr hyperparam to learning rate function |Arbitrary constant
| |learning_rate_warmup_steps hyperparam to lr function |Arbitrary constant

|===

Some benchmarks may require extensions of these policies; submitters are encouraged to request extensions based on data.

For version 0.6, MLPerf will be moving to a batchsize-to-hyperparameter-and-optimizer table. 

OPEN: Hyperparameters and optimizer may be freely changed.

=== Loss function 
CLOSED: The same loss function used in the reference implementation must be used.

OPEN: Any loss function may be used. Do not confuse the loss function with target quality measure.

=== Quality measure
Each run must reach a target quality level on the reference implementation quality measure. The time to measure quality is included in the wallclock time. 

The same quality measure as the reference implementation must be used. The quality measure must be evaluated at least as frequently (in terms of number of training items between test sets) and at least as thoroughly (in terms of number of tests per set) as in the reference implementation as shown on the table below. Typically, a test consists of comparing the output of one forward pass through the network with the desired output from the test set.

|===
|Area |Problem |Model|Evaluation frequency

|Vision |Image classification |Resnet-50 v1.5|Every 4 epochs with offset 0 or 1 or 2 or 3
|       |Object detection (light weight) |SSD|Fixed at iterations=120000, 160000, 180000, 200000, 220000, 240000
|       |Object detection (heavy weight) |Mask R-CNN|Every 1 epoch 
|Language|Translation (recurrent) |NMT|Every 1 epoch 
|        |Translation (non-recurrent) |Transformer|Every 1 epoch 
|Commerce|Recommendation |Neural Collaborative Filtering|Every 1 epoch 
|General|Reinforcement learning |Mini Go|Every 1 epoch   
|===

Check points can be created at the discretion of submitter. No check points are required to be produced or retained. This policy is intended to simplify v0.5 and will be reconsidered.

=== Equivalence exceptions
The CLOSED division allows limited exemptions to mathematical equivalence between implementations for pragmatic purposes, including:

* Different methods can be used to add color jitter as long as the methods are of a similar distribution and magnitude to the reference.

* If data set size is not evenly divisible by batch size, one of several techniques may be used. The last batch in an epoch may be composed of the remaining samples in the epoch, may be padded, or may be a mixed batch composed of samples from the end of one epoch and the start of the next. If the mixed batch technique is used, quality for the ending epoch must be evaluated after the mixed batch. If the padding technique is used, the first batch may be padded instead of the last batch.

* Values introduced for padding purposes may be reflected in batch norm computations.

* Adam optimizer implementations may use the very small value epsilon to maintain mathematical stability in slightly different ways, provided that methods are reviewed and approved in advance. One such method involves squaring the value of epsilon and moving epsilon inside the square root in the parameter update equation.

* ImageNet has 1000 classes but the reference uses 1001. TF has an additional 'I don't know' class. Both are allowed.

Additional exemptions need to be explicitly requested and approved in advance. In general, exemptions may be approved for techniques that are common industry practice, introduce small differences that would be difficult to engineer around relative to their significance, and do not substantially decrease the required computation. Over time, MLPerf should seek to help the industry converge on standards and remove exemptions.

The OPEN division does not restrict mathematical equivalence.

== Run Results
A run result consists of a wall-clock timing measurement for an entire run, including model construction, any data preprocessing required to be on the clock, training, and quality testing. 

The clock must start before any part of the system performs any benchmark specific work (e.g. model creation, or dataset manipulation), and may be stopped as soon as any part of the system determines target accuracy has been reached.

The clock may not be paused during the run.

== Benchmark Results
Each benchmark result is based on a set of run results. The number of results for each benchmark is based on a combination of the variance of the benchmark result, the cost of each run, and the likelihood of convergence.

|===
|Area|Problem |Number of Runs

|Vision |Image classification |5
| |Object detection (light weight) |5
| |Object detection (heavy weight) |5
|Language |Translation (recurrent) |10
| |Translation (non-recurrent) |10
|Commerce |Recommendation |Run 100, use first 50 that converge
|General |Reinforcement learning |20
|===

Each benchmark result is computed by dropping the fastest and slowest runs, then taking the mean of the remaining times.

Each benchmark result should be normalized by dividing the reference result for the corresponding reference implementation by the benchmark result. This normalization produces higher numbers for better results, which better aligns with human intuition.

== Appendix: FAQ
1. For NCF, the test positive example must always come last if there is a tie.
