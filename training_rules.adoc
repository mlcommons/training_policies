= MLPerf Training Rules
Version 0.7 
May 2nd, 2018

== Overview
This document describes how to implement the MLPerf Training Suite using an ML framework and how to use that implementation to measure the performance of an ML software framework or hardware. 

There are seperate rules for the submission, review, and publication process for all MLPerf benchmarks https://github.com/mlperf/policies/blob/master/submission_rules.adoc[here].

The MLPerf name and logo are trademarks. In order to refer to a result using the MLPerf name, the result must conform to the letter and spirit of the rules specified in this document. The MLPerf organization reserves the right to solely determine if a use of its name or logo is acceptable.

=== Definitions (read this section carefully)
The following definitions are used throughout this document:

_Performance_ always refers to execution speed.

_Quality_ always refers to a model’s ability to produce “correct” outputs.

A _system_ consists of a defined set of hardware resources such as processors, memories, disks, and interconnect. It also includes specific versions of all software such as operating system, compilers, libraries, and drivers that significantly influences the running time of a benchmark, excluding the ML framework.

A _framework_ is a specific version of a software library or set of related libraries, possibly with associated offline compiler, for training ML models using a system. Examples include specific versions of Caffe2, MXNet, PaddlePaddle, pyTorch, or TensorFlow.

A _benchmark_ is an abstract problem that can be solved using ML by training a model based on a specific dataset or simulation environment to a target quality level. 

A _suite_ is a specific set of benchmarks.

A _division_ is a set of rules for implementing benchmarks from a suite to produce a class of comparable results.

A _reference implementation_ is a specific implementation of a benchmark provided by the MLPerf organization. 

A _benchmark implementation_ is an implementation of a benchmark in a particular framework by a user under the rules of a specific division.

A _submission implementation set_ is a set of benchmark implementations for one or more benchmarks from a suite under the rules of a specific division using the same framework.

A _run_ is a complete execution of an implementation on a system, training a model from initialization to the quality target.

A _run result_ is the wallclock time required for a run.

A _reference result_ is the result provided by the MLPerf organization for each reference implementation

A _benchmark result_ is the mean of a benchmark-specific number of run results, dropping the highest and lowest results. The result is then normalized to the reference result for that benchmark. Normalization is of the form (reference result / benchmark result) such that a better benchmark result produces a higher number.

A _submission result set_ is a one benchmark result for each benchmark implementation in a  submission implementation set.

A _submission_ is a submission implementation set and a corresponding submission result set.

A _custom summary result_ is the weighted geometric mean of an arbitrary set of results from a specific submission. MLPerf endorses this methodology for computing custom summary results but does not endorse any official summary result. 

== General rules
The following rules apply to all benchmark implementations.

=== Strive to be fair
Benchmarking should be conducted to measure the framework and system performance as fairly as possible. Ethics and reputation matter.

=== System and framework must be consistent
The same system and framework must be used for a submission result set. Note that the reference implementations do not all use the same framework.

=== Benchmark detection is not allowed
The framework and system should not detect and behave differently for benchmarks.

=== Pre-training is not allowed
Unless part of the definition of a benchmark, the implementation should not encode any information about the content of the dataset or a successful model’s state in any form. High-level statistical information about the dataset, such as distribution of sizes, may be used.

For benchmarks which are defined as starting from a fixed set of weights, such as a checkpoint or backbone, the implementation should start from the weights provided in the benchmark reference definition, or if that is not posssible, provide  information and code sufficient for reproducing how those starting weights were obtained. For v0.7, sets of weights used in v0.6 are allowed.

== Benchmarks
The benchmark suite consists of the benchmarks shown in the following table.

|===
|Area|Problem |Dataset

|Vision |Image classification |ImageNet
| |Image segmentation (medical) |KiTS19
| |Object detection (light weight) |COCO
| |Object detection (heavy weight) |COCO

A “verify_dataset” script that verifies the dataset against the checksum.

A “run_and_time” script that executes the benchmark and reports the wall-clock time.

== Divisions
There are two divisions of the benchmark suite, the Closed division and the Open division. 

=== Closed Division
The Closed division requires using the same preprocessing, model, training method, and quality target as the reference implementation.

The closed division models and quality targets are:

|===
|Area |Problem |Model |Target

|Vision |Image classification |ResNet-50 v1.5 |75.90% classification
| |Image segmentation (medical) |U-Net3D |0.908 Mean DICE score
| |Object detection (light weight) |SSD |23.0% mAP
| |Object detection (heavy weight) |Mask R-CNN |0.377 Box min AP and 0.339 Mask min AP
|Language |Translation (recurrent) |NMT |24.0 Sacre BLEU
| |Translation (non-recurrent) |Transformer |25.00 BLEU
| |NLP |BERT |0.712 Mask-LM accuracy
|Commerce |Recommendation |DLRM |0.8025 AUC
|Research |Reinforcement learning |Mini Go (based on Alpha Go paper) |50% win rate vs. checkpoint
|===

Closed division benchmarks must be referred to using the benchmark name plus the term Closed, e.g. “for the Image Classification Closed benchmark, the system achieved a result of 7.2.”

=== Open Division
The Open division allows using arbitrary training data, preprocessing, model, and/or training method. However, the Open division still requires using supervised or reinforcement machine learning in which a model is iteratively improved based on training data, simulation, or self-play.

Open division benchmarks must be referred to using the benchmark name plus the term Open, e.g. “for the Image Classification Open benchmark, the system achieved a result of 7.2.”

== Basics 

=== Random numbers
CLOSED: Random numbers must be generated using stock random number generators. 

Random number generators may be seeded from the following sources:

* Clock
* System source of randomness, e.g. /dev/random or /dev/urandom
* Another random number generator initialized with an allowed seed

Random number generators may be initialized repeatedly in multiple processes or threads. For a single run, the same seed may be shared across multiple processes or threads.

OPEN: Any random number generation may be used.

=== Numerical formats
CLOSED: The numerical formats fp64, fp32, tf32, fp16, bfloat16, Graphcore FLOAT 16.16, int8, uint8, int4, and uint4 are pre-approved for use. Additional formats require explicit approval. Scaling may be added where required to compensate for different precision.

OPEN: Any format and scaling may be used.

=== Epoch numbering
Epochs should always be numbered from 1.

=== Result rounding
Public results should be rounded normally.

== Data Set

=== Data State at Start of Run
CLOSED: Each reference implementation includes a script to download the input dataset and script to verify the dataset using a checksum. The data must then be preprocessed in a manner consistent with the reference implementation, excepting any transformations that must be done for each run (e.g. random transformations). The data may also be reformatted for the target system provided that the reformatting does not introduce new information or introduce duplicate copies of data. 

OPEN: Any public dataset may be used for training the model, however the evaluation data must be drawn from the benchmark dataset in a manner consistent with the reference.

You must flush the cache or restart the system prior to benchmarking.	Data can start on any durable storage system such as local disks and cloud storage systems. This explicitly excludes RAM.	

=== Preprocessing During the Run
Only preprocessing that must be done for each run (e.g. random transformations) must be timed.

CLOSED: The same preprocessing steps as the reference implementation must be used. 

OPEN: Any preprocessing steps are allowed for training data. However, each datum must be preprocessed individually in a manner that is not influenced by any other data. The evaluation data must be preprocessed in a manner consistent with reference.

=== Data Representation

CLOSED: Images must have the same size as in the reference implementation. Mathematically equivalent padding of images is allowed.

CLOSED: For benchmarks with sequence inputs, you may choose a length N and either truncate all examples to length N or throw out all examples which exceed length N. This must be done uniformly for all examples. This may only be done on the training set and not the evaluation set. 

CLOSED: Two ways to represent the Mask R-CNN mask are permitted. One is a polygon and the other is a scalable bitmask. 

OPEN: The closed division data representations restrictions only apply at the start of the run. Data may be represented in an arbitrary fashion during the run.

=== Other Uses of Data

Input encoding data, such as language vocabulary, or the set of possible labels may used during pre-processing or execution without counting as "touching the training data" for timing purposes.

=== Training and Test Sets
CLOSED: If applicable, the dataset must be separated into training and test sets in the same manner as the reference implementation.

OPEN: If applicable, the test dataset must be extracted in the same manner as the reference implementation. The training data set may not contain data that appears in the test set.

=== Training Data Order
CLOSED: the training and test data must be traversed in the same conceptual order as the reference implementation. For instance, the data might be traversed sequentially or randomly with uniform distribution. Batch size, shard size, and the random number generator will affect order.

Where data pipelines randomly order data, arbitrary sharding, batching, and packing are allowed provided that (1) the data is still overall randomly ordered and not ordered to improve convergence and (2) each datum still appears exactly once.

For DLRM the submissions are allowed to use a preshuffled dataset and are not obligated to shuffle the data once more during training. However, the reference implementation uses both preshuffled data and an approximate "batch shuffle" performed on-the-fly. Reference runs should also use a different seed in each run, so that the order of the training batches in each reference run is different. Even though the submissions are allowed to not shuffle the data on-the-fly, they are obligated to match the convergence behavior of the reference which does perform on-the-fly "batch-shuffle". Using a preshuffled dataset with a hand-crafted, advantageous data ordering is disallowed.

OPEN: The training data may be traversed in any order. The test data must be traversed in the same order as the reference implementation.

== RL Environment
CLOSED: The implementation must use the same RL algorithm and simulator or game as the reference implementation, with the same parameters. 

OPEN: The implementation may use a different RL algorithm but must use the same simulator or game with the same parameters. If the reference implementation generates all data online, the Open division implementation must also generate all data online.

It is allowed and encouraged to parallelize and otherwise optimize (e.g. by implementing in a compiled language) the RL environment provided that the semantics are preserved.

== Model
CLOSED: The benchmark implementation must use the same model as the reference implementation, as defined by the remainder of this section.

OPEN: The benchmark implementation may use a different model. 

=== Graph Definition

CLOSED: Each of the current frameworks has a graph that describes the operations performed during the forward propagation of training. The frameworks automatically infer and execute the corresponding back-propagation computations from this graph. Benchmark implementations must use the same graph as the reference implementation.

=== Weight and Bias Initialization
CLOSED: Weights and biases must be initialized using the same constant or random value distribution as the reference implementation, unless a pre-trained set of weights, such as a checkpoint or backbone, is used by the reference.

OPEN: Weights and biases must be initialized using a consistent constant or random value distribution. 

=== Graph Execution
CLOSED: Frameworks are free to optimize the non-weight parts of the computation graph provided that the changes are mathematically equivalent. So optimizations and graph / code transformations of the flavor of dead code elimination, common subexpression elimination, loop-invariant code motion, and recomputation of node state are entirely allowed. 

OPEN: Frameworks are free to alter the graph.

== Training Loop

=== Hyperparameters
CLOSED: 

By default, the hyperparameters must be the same as the reference. 

Hyperparameters include the optimizer used and values like the regularization norms and weight decays.

The implementation of the optimizer must match the optimizer specified in the Appendex: Allowed Optimizer.  The Appendex lists which optimizers in the popular deep learning frameworks are compliant by default.  If a submission uses an alternate implementation, the submitter must describe the optimizer's equation and demonstrate equivalence with the approved optimizers on that list.

The following table lists the tunable hyperparameters for each allowed model,optimizer combination. The value of each tunable hyperparameter must meet the listed constraint. 

The MLPerf verifier scripts checks all hyperparameters except those with names marked with asterisks. If a hyperparameter is marked with one asterisk, it must be checked manually. If a hyperparameter is marked with two asterisks, it is also not logged and it must be checked manually in the code.  If the verifier and the constraints in this table differ, the verifier (specifically, the version on the date of submission unless otherwise decided by the review committee) is the source of truth.

OPEN: Hyperparameters and optimizer may be freely changed.

=== Hyperparameter Borrowing

During the review period as described in the Submission Rules, a submitter may replace the hyperparameters in their implementation of a benchmark with hyperparameters from another submitter's implementation of the same benchmark. By default, they may or may not replace batch size but must replace all other hyperparameters as a group. With evidence that the resulting model converges worse in terms of epochs required (taking into account batch size and precision) they may make a minimum number of additional hyperparameter changes in order to achieve comparable convergence in epochs.

=== Loss function 
CLOSED: The same loss function used in the reference implementation must be used.

OPEN: Any loss function may be used. Do not confuse the loss function with target quality measure.

=== Quality measure
Each run must reach a target quality level on the reference implementation quality measure. By default, the time to evaluate the quality is included in the wallclock time. However, if the reference implementation generates timestamped checkpoints and evaluates the quality after the clock has been stopped, then an implementation may either perform evaluation on-the-clock or generate timestamped checkpoints, evaluate them after the clock has been stopped, and update the clock stopped time to the timestamp of the first passing checkpoint. The checkpoint timestamp may be any time after the last weight value included in the checkpoint is updated.

CLOSED: The same quality measure as the reference implementation must be used. The quality measure must be evaluated at least as frequently (in terms of number of training items between test sets) and at least as thoroughly (in terms of number of tests per set) as in the reference implementation. Typically, a test consists of comparing the output of one forward pass through the network with the desired output from the test set.

|===

OPEN: An arbitrary stopping criteria may be used, including but not limited to the closed quality measure, a different quality measure, the number of epochs, or a fixed time. However, the reported results must include the geometric mean of the final quality as measured by the closed quality measure.

Check points can be created at the discretion of submitter. No check points are required to be produced or retained.

=== Equivalence exceptions
The CLOSED division allows limited exemptions to mathematical equivalence between implementations for pragmatic purposes, including:

* Different methods can be used to add color jitter as long as the methods are of a similar distribution and magnitude to the reference.

* If data set size is not evenly divisible by batch size, one of several techniques may be used. The last batch in an epoch may be composed of the remaining samples in the epoch, may be padded, or may be a mixed batch composed of samples from the end of one epoch and the start of the next. If the mixed batch technique is used, quality for the ending epoch must be evaluated after the mixed batch. If the padding technique is used, the first batch may be padded instead of the last batch.

* Values introduced for padding purposes may be reflected in batch norm computations.

* Adam optimizer implementations may use the very small value epsilon to maintain mathematical stability in slightly different ways, provided that methods are reviewed and approved in advance. One such method involves squaring the value of epsilon and moving epsilon inside the square root in the parameter update equation.

* Distributed batch normalization is allowed.

Additional exemptions need to be explicitly requested and approved in advance. In general, exemptions may be approved for techniques that are common industry practice, introduce small differences that would be difficult to engineer around relative to their significance, and do not substantially decrease the required computation. Over time, MLPerf should seek to help the industry converge on standards and remove exemptions.

The OPEN division does not restrict mathematical equivalence.

== Run Results
A run result consists of a wall-clock timing measurement for a contiguous period that includes model initialization in excess of a maximum initialization time, any data preprocessing required to be on the clock, using the dataset to train the model, and quality evaluation unless specified otherwise for the benchmark.

Prior to starting the clock, a system may use a maximum of 20 minutes of model initialization time. Model initialization time begins when the system first begins to construct or execute the model. This maximum initialization time is intended to ensure that model initialization is not disproportionate on large systems intended to run much larger models, and may be adjusted in the future with sufficient evidence.

The clock must start before any part of the system touches the dataset or when the maximum model initialization time is exceeded. The clock may be stopped as soon as any part of the system determines target accuracy has been reached. The clock may not be paused during the run.

== Benchmark Results
Each benchmark result is based on a set of run results. The number of results for each benchmark is based on a combination of the variance of the benchmark result, the cost of each run, and the likelihood of convergence.

|===
|Area|Problem |Number of Runs

|Vision |Image classification |5
| |Image segmentation (medical) | 20
| |Object detection (light weight) |5
| |Object detection (heavy weight) |5
|Language |Translation (recurrent) |10
| |Translation (non-recurrent) |10
| |NLP |10
| |Speech recognition (recurrent) |10
|Commerce |Recommendation |5
|Research |Reinforcement learning |10
|===

Each benchmark result is computed by dropping the fastest and slowest runs, then taking the mean of the remaining times. For this purpose, a single non-converging run may be treated as the slowest run and dropped. A benchmark result is invalid if there is more than one non-converging run.

Each benchmark result should be normalized by dividing the reference result for the corresponding reference implementation by the benchmark result. This normalization produces higher numbers for better results, which better aligns with human intuition.

== Appendix: Benchmark Specific Rules

* ResNet

** ResNet may have 1000 or 1001 classes, where the 1001st is "I don't know"
