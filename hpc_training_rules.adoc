= MLPerf HPC Training Rules

Version 0.7 
July 16, 2020

Points of contact: David Kanter (dkanter@gmail.com), Steve Farrell (sfarrell@lbl.gov)

== Overview

All rules are taken from the MLPerf Training Rules except for those that are overridden here.

The MLPerf name and logo are trademarks. In order to refer to a result using the
MLPerf name, the result must conform to the letter and spirit of the rules
specified in this document. The MLPerf organization reserves the right to solely
determine if a use of its name or logo is acceptable.

== Benchmarks

The benchmark suite consists of the benchmarks shown in the following table.

|===
|Problem |Dataset |Quality Target
|Climate segmentation |CAM5+TECA climate simulation with 3 target classes (atmospheric river, tropical cyclone, background) |IOU 0.82
|Cosmological parameter prediction |CosmoFlow N-body cosmological simulation data with 4 cosmological parameter targets |Mean average error 0.124
|Modeling catalysts |Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) S2EF 2M training split, ID validation set| Forces mean absolute error 0.036
|===

== Divisions

There are two divisions of the HPC benchmark suite, the Closed division and the Open division.

=== Closed Division

The Closed division requires using the same preprocessing, model, and training method as the reference implementation.

The closed division models are:

|===
|Problem |Model
|Climate segmentation  |https://github.com/azrael417/mlperf-deepcam
|Cosmological parameter prediction |https://github.com/sparticlesteve/cosmoflow-benchmark
|Modeling catalysts |https://github.com/sparticlesteve/ocp/tree/mlperf-hpc-reference
|===

== Data Set

=== Data State at Start of Run

Each reference implementation includes a download script or broadly available method to acquire and verify the dataset.

The data at the start of the benchmark run should reside on a parallel file system that is persistent (>= 1 month, not subject to eviction by other users), can be downloaded to / accessed by the user, and can be shared among users at the facility. Any staging to node-local disk or memory or system burst buffer should be included in the benchmark time measurement.

You must flush/reset the on-node caches prior to benchmarking. Due to practicality issues, you are not required to reset off-node system-level caches.

We otherwise follow the training rule on consistency with the reference implementation preprocessing and allowance for reformatting.

== Training Loop

=== Hyperparameters and Optimizer

CLOSED:

Allowed hyperparameter and optimizer settings will be specified in the MLPerf HPC v0.5 Hyperparameter List. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jxsas4RRxKoKmIYcFZcFCQ1ZLnaMLSU8B5g5ZDKQ7sE/edit?usp=sharing

OPEN: Hyperparameters and optimizer may be freely changed.

== Run Results

We follow MLPerf Training Rule 10 with the addition that data staging to node-local storage or I/O accelerators must also be timed as described in Rule 6.1 above.

You are encouraged to also report the additional metrics of the benchmark described in the MLPerf HPC v0.5 Metrics List (to be prepared).

== Benchmark Results

We follow the MLPerf Training Rule 11 along with the following required number of runs per benchmark.

|===
|Benchmark |Number of Runs
|DeepCAM | 5
|CosmoFlow | 10
|OpenCatalyst | 5
